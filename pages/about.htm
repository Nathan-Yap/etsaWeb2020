        <h3>Chapters</h3>
        <p>TSA chapters take the study of STEM beyond the classroom and give students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, TSA chapter members work on competitive events, learn and apply leadership skills, and may attend conferences at the state, regional, and national levels. TSA chapters also are committed to a national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups in the community. TSA members may become officers within their state and then run for national office. To learn how to start a TSA chapter, call 703-860-9000 or join TSA.</p>

        <h3>Curriculum Integration</h3>
        <p>Education directives at the federal and state levels focus on providing avenues for initiatives such as STEM education. As a career and technical student organization (CTSO), TSA helps teachers meet the criteria for STEM education goals through exciting programs that include activities, competitions, leadership, and teamwork for students. In addition, all TSA activities are correlated to the Standards for Technological Literacy, as set forth by the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA). Teachers can use TSA activities during the school day in their classroom, and extend the learning beyond the classroom through a TSA chapter.</p>
